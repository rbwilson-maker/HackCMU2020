# HackCMU2020
First Hackathon with Maddie, Steven, and Annika (and Max):

Goal: make a program like hangman that gets closer to the person's death based on amount of covid cases

Script:

Annika: Are you tired of looking at weird graphs and random numbers?? Me too!

Steven: Well our Hangman COVID Tracker is an easy way to visualize data and guage the severity of the pandemic in the 56 united states and territories. 

Maddie: When you type in a state, the program fills in the figure based on the most recent percentage of test positivity rate. 

Rachel: As you can see, you can open multiple windows to compare states, and high and low percentages present different helpful messages.
